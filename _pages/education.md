<h3>Thesis: Perspective Effect on Shaping Social Interaction Understanding</h3>
I study how perspective shifts (from first-person to third-person) affect the perception of social interactions, integrating behavioral and fMRI approaches to gain a deeper understanding of our world. I'm also analyzing how stimulus inversion affects dynamic object recognition when
recognition relies solely on motion cues using behavioral data.

<h3>Thesis: Predicting Eye Gaze Points with Deep Learning</h3>
For my B.Sc. thesis, I developed a deep learning model to predict eye gaze points in videos. This work builds on my previous research in neuromarketing, where I gained experience working with eye tracking data. Given the novelty and versatility of deep learning, I saw an opportunity to apply these techniques to model visual attention and interest.

Specifically, my thesis focuses on training a neural network to predict the specific points in a video that a viewer will look at. The model takes in video frames and outputs heatmaps indicating the probability of gaze at each pixel. This could have applications in fields like marketing, to see what product elements draw attention, or filmmaking, to understand viewer engagement.
